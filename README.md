### to do chatbot using python 

follow the **steps**:

1. create python file to create chatbot as **main.py** file   and json file  as **intents.json** file  for Common words (message and responses)
    *  I created a folder called Chatbot to put both files in it

2.  open Anaconda Prompt (miniconda3) :
   **_note_**  If you want to know the type of version just write  in Prompt this command : ` python` as **python_version.png.**
   
1. prepare conda environment of python 3.6 by this command :
    `conda create -n chatbot python=3.6` 
  **_note_** chatbot her is just name 
1. activate the chatbot project environment:
  ` activate chatbot`
1. install all library  that we need 
  ` pip install nltk`

   `pip install numpy`

   `pip install tflearn`

   `pip install tensorflow`
